/dev/random produces random output generated by a CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generator) inside the linux kernel. In the unix-like environment, cryptographically secure random numbers are generated by mixing deterministic, predictable events generated by the computer with events that are random and unpredictable, such as input from a user (keyboard, mouse) or from devices (disk interrupts, timings). Together, these deterministic and random events are thoroughly mixed to create a pool of random bytes that can be used for anything, like encrypted keys. Since the linux kernel has privileged access to information about user, hardware, and device events that can be used as sources of “randomness”, the CSPRNG reads in these events and uses their “randomness” to ensure that it creates an entropy pool whose original values cannot be discovered. /dev/random is different from /dev/urandom in that it requires the entropy pool to have a
